   ## Search Algorithm

        A search algorithm is an algorithm (if more than one, algorithms[1]) designed to solve a search problem. 
        Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, 
        with either discrete or continuous values.
    
    
   ## Space Complexity

          The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. 
          Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
